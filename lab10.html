<h3>Dialog tag:</h3>
<dialog open>Earth's expected long-term future is tied to that of the Sun. Over the next 1.1 billion years, solar luminosity will increase by 10%
  , and over the next 3.5 billion years by 40%.[81] Earth's increasing surface temperature will accelerate the inorganic carbon cycle, reducing 
  CO2 concentration to levels lethally low for plants (10 ppm for C4 photosynthesis) in approximately 100–900 million years. The lack of 
  vegetation will result in the loss of oxygen in the atmosphere, making animal life impossible.[84] Due to the increased luminosity, Earth's
   mean temperature may reach 100 °C (212 °F) in 1.5 billion years, and all ocean water will evaporate and be lost to space, which may trigger
    a runaway greenhouse effect, within an estimated 1.6 to 3 billion years.[85] Even if the Sun were stable, a fraction of the water in the 
    modern oceans will descend to the mantle, due to reduced steam venting from mid-ocean ridges.</dialog>
